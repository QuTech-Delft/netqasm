        In most cases, you will want to instantiate a subclass of this.

        :param app_name: Name of the application.
            Specifically, this is the name of the program that runs on this particular
            node. So, `app_name` can often be seen as the name of the "role" within the
            multi-party application or protocol.
            For example, in a Blind Computation protocol, the two roles may be
            "client" and "server"; the `app_name` of a particular
            `BaseNetQASMConnection` instance may then e.g. be "client".

        :param node_name: name of the Node that is controlled by the quantum
            node controller that we connect to. The Node name may be different from
            the `app_name`, and e.g. reflect its geographical location, like a city
            name. If None, the Node name is obtained by querying the global
            `NetworkInfo` by using the `app_name`.

        :param app_id: ID of this application.
            An application registered in the quantum node controller using this
            connection will use this app ID.
            If None, a unique ID will be chosen (unique among possible other
            applications that were registered through other BaseNetQASMConnection
            instances).

        :param max_qubits: maximum number of qubits that can be in use
            at the same time by applications registered through this connection.
            Defaults to 5.

        :param hardware_config: configuration object with info about the underlying
            hardware. Used by the Builder of this Connection. When None,
            a generic configuration object is created with the default qubit count of 5.

        :param log_config: configuration object specifying what to log.

        :param epr_sockets: list of EPR sockets.
            If `_setup_epr_sockets` is True, these EPR sockets are automatically
            opened upon entering this connection's context.

        :param compiler: the class that is used to instantiate the compiler.
            If None, a compiler is used that can compile for the hardware of the
            node this connection is to.

        :param return_arrays: whether to add "return array"-instructions at the end
            of subroutines. A reason to set this to False could be that a quantum
            node controller does not support returning arrays back to the Host.

        :param _init_app: whether to immediately send a "register application" message
            to the quantum node controller upon construction of this connection.

        :param _setup_epr_sockets: whether to immediately send "open EPR socket"
            messages to the quantum node controller upon construction of this
            connection. If True, the "open EPR socket" messages are for the EPR sockets
            defined in the `epr_sockets` parameter.
