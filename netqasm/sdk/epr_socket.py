class EPRSocket(abc.ABC):
    """EPR socket class. Used to generate entanglement with a remote node.

    An EPR socket represents a connection with a single remote node through which
    EPR pairs can be generated. Its main interfaces are the `create` and `recv`
    methods. A typical use case for two nodes is that they both create an EPR socket
    to the other node, and during the protocol, one of the nodes does `create`
    operations on its socket while the other node does `recv` operations.

    A `create` operation asks the network stack to initiate generation of EPR pairs
    with the remote node. Depending on the type of generation, the result of this
    operation can be qubit objects or measurement outcomes.
    A `recv` operation asks the network stack to wait for the remote node to initiate
    generation of EPR pairs. Again, the result can be qubit objects or measurement
    outcomes.

    Each `create` operation on one node must be matched by a `recv` operation on the
    other node. Since "creating" and "receiving" must happen at the same time, a node
    that is doing a `create` operation on its socket cannot advance until the other
    node does the corresponding `recv`. This is different from classical network
    sockets where a "send" operation (roughly anologous to `create` in an EPR socket)
    does not block on the remote node receiving it.

    An EPR socket is identified by a triple consisting of (1) the remote node ID,
    (2) the local socket ID and (3) the remote socket ID.
    Two nodes that want to generate EPR pairs with each other should make sure that the
    IDs in their local sockets match.

        them in memory.

        A `create_keep` operation must always be matched by a `recv_keep` operation on
        the remote node.

        If `sequential` is False (default), this operation returns a list of Qubit
        objects representing the local qubits that are each one half of the generated
        pairs. These qubits can then be manipulated locally just like locally
        initialized qubits, by e.g. applying gates or measuring them.
        Each qubit also contains information about the entanglement generation that
        lead to its creation, and can be accessed by its `entanglement_info` property.

        A typical example for just generating one pair with another node would be:

        .. code-block::

            q = epr_socket.create_keep()[0]
            # `q` can now be used as a normal qubit

        If `sequential` is False (default), the all requested EPR pairs are generated
        at once, before returning the results (qubits or entanglement info objects).

        If `sequential` is True, a callback function (`post_routine`) should be
        specified. After generating one EPR pair, this callback will be called, before
        generating the next pair. This method can e.g. be used to generate many EPR
        pairs (more than the number of physical qubits available), by measuring (and
        freeing up) each qubit before the next pair is generated.

        For example:

        .. code-block::

            outcomes = alice.new_array(num)

            def post_create(conn, q, pair):
                q.H()
                outcome = outcomes.get_future_index(pair)
                q.measure(outcome)

        :param post_routine: callback function for each genated pair. Only used if
            `sequential` is True.
            The callback should take three arguments `(conn, q, pair)` where
            * `conn` is the connection (e.g. `self`)
            * `q` is the entangled qubit (of type `FutureQubit`)
            * `pair` is a register holding which pair is handled (0, 1, ...)

            qubits should ideally still have at the moment the last qubit has been
            generated. For example, when specifying `number=2` and

            make sure that both qubits have a fidelity of at least 80% when the

        """Ask the network stack to generate EPR pairs with the remote node.

        A `create` operation must always be matched by a `recv` operation on the remote
        node.

        If the type of request is Create and Keep (CK, or just K) and if `sequential`
        is False (default), this operation returns a list of Qubit objects representing
        the local qubits that are each one half of the generated pairs. These qubits
        can then be manipulated locally just like locally initialized qubits, by e.g.
        applying gates or measuring them.
        Each qubit also contains information about the entanglement generation that
        lead to its creation, and can be accessed by its `entanglement_info` property.

        A typical example for just generating one pair with another node would be:

        .. code-block::

            q = epr_socket.create()[0]
            # `q` can now be used as a normal qubit

        If the type of request is Measure Directly (MD, or just M), this operation
        returns a list of Linklayer response objects. These objects contain information
        about the entanglement generation and includes the measurement outcome and
        basis used. Note that all values are `Future` objects. This means that the
        current subroutine must be flushed before the values become defined.

        An example for generating 10 pairs with another node that are immediately
        measured:

        .. code-block::

            # list of Futures that become defined when subroutine is flushed
            outcomes = []
            with NetQASMConnection("alice", epr_sockets=[epr_socket]):
                ent_infos = epr_socket.create(number=10, tp=EPRType.M)
                for ent_info in ent_infos:
                    outcomes.append(ent_info.measurement_outcome)

        For "Measure Directly"-type requests, the basis to measure in can also be
        specified. There are 3 ways to specify a basis:

        * using one of the `EprMeasBasis` variants
        * by specifying 3 rotation angles, interpreted as an X-rotation, a Y-rotation
          and another X-rotation. For example, setting `rotations_local` to (8, 0, 0)
          means that before measuring, an X-rotation of 8*pi/16 = pi/2 radians is
          applied to the qubit.
        * using one of the `RandomBasis` variants, in which case one of the bases of
          that variant is chosen at random just before measuring

        NOTE: the node that initiates the entanglement generation, i.e. the one that
        calls `create` on its EPR socket, also controls the measurement bases of the
        receiving node (by setting e.g. `rotations_remote`). The receiving node cannot
        change this.

        If `sequential` is False (default), the all requested EPR pairs are generated
        at once, before returning the results (qubits or entanglement info objects).

        If `sequential` is True, a callback function (`post_routine`) should be
        specified. After generating one EPR pair, this callback will be called, before
        generating the next pair. This method can e.g. be used to generate many EPR
        pairs (more than the number of physical qubits available), by measuring (and
        freeing up) each qubit before the next pair is generated.

        For example:

        .. code-block::

            outcomes = alice.new_array(num)

            def post_create(conn, q, pair):
                q.H()
                outcome = outcomes.get_future_index(pair)
                q.measure(outcome)
            epr_socket.create(number=num, post_routine=post_create, sequential=True)

        :param post_routine: callback function for each genated pair. Only used if
            `sequential` is True.
            The callback should take three arguments `(conn, q, pair)` where
            * `conn` is the connection (e.g. `self`)
            * `q` is the entangled qubit (of type `FutureQubit`)
            * `pair` is a register holding which pair is handled (0, 1, ...)
        :param sequential: whether to use callbacks after each pair, defaults to False
        :param tp: type of entanglement generation, defaults to EPRType.K. Note that
            corresponding `recv` of the remote node's EPR socket must specify the
